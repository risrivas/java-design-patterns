# Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)
########################################
- there should never be more than one reason for a class to change
- focused, single functionality
- addresses a specific concern

example:
- there is a class writing to a remote server
- if protocol changes from HTTP to HTTPS - class has to change
- if payload format changes from JSON to XML - class has to change
- if authentication is added in server - class has to change
=> thus there are more than 1 reason for the class to change - breaks the SRP
